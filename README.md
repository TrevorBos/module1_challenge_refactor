# module1_challenge_refactor
Module 1 challenge. 

In this challenge we were given a website that worked, but the code wasn't the most ideal. Our task was to take the code from both the HTML and CSS files given and make
it so that they still function the same way, but just look better and more accesible while doing it.

## Where it started.

As you can see there have been numerous changes made to both files, comments added, semantic code used, and alt tags for accessibilty, and it still works the way it
is meant to be.
